        The person leading the U.S. response to the
        <a href="">coronavirus outbreak</a>, Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the U.S.
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is preparing herself and her
        family for a possible pandemic that could cause “severe” disruption to
        everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools possibly close,
        and social gatherings are discouraged.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “We really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that
        their lives will be disrupted because of this pandemic.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That would seem to be already the case. Community spreading — cases that
        appear without a known source of exposure — are now occurring in Hong
        Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.
